        <p><em>This is not going to be a technical post. I will tell a short history of why I’m creating this application, where I’m currently at and where I’m heading.</em></p>

<p>One year ago while converting an old workflow of scripted settings into configuration profiles I became frustrated that none of the tools I tried gave me enough granularity when choosing what to manage.</p>

<p>All tools seemed to copy the <a href="http://www.apple.com/osx/server/features/#profile-manager">Profile Manager</a> GUI with a set of predetermined payloads that gathered a logical group of payload keys into a single setting. No tool offered the option to choose which of the predetermined keys in the payload I wanted.</p>

<p><em>I either had to manage all of them, or none of them.</em></p>

<p>This meant I had to do my configuration in the UI, export the configuration profile and manually remove the things I didn’t want to force upon the user.</p>

<p>This process made me decide I had to create my own tool where I could choose exactly which keys I wanted to manage. And much more.</p>

<p>I named it <a href="https://github.com/erikberglund/ProfileCreator">ProfileCreator</a>.</p>

<h1 id="alpha">Alpha</h1>

<p>I created a proof of concept application to test the features I would like to see, and those tests have been very successful. But to make the application more structured and easier to maintain I started over with an empty project and have been rebuilding it for the past 2-3 months.</p>

<p>I have been asked about the progress of this project by a lot of people so I wanted to get it in the hands of admins as to test and leave feedback as soon as the foundation was ready.</p>

<p>Therefor, this first alpha release will have the following limitations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Only one payload type is available: <strong>Certificates</strong> (as per request of <a href="https://grahamgilbert.com">Graham Gilbert</a>)</li>
  <li>Only one payload per payload type (even if the payload type allows for more).</li>
  <li>No preview when selecting a profile in the main window.</li>
  <li>No indication if the payload contains an invalid configuration.</li>
  <li>No option to customize what payload keys are included.</li>
</ul>

<p>Basically, you can only create a configuration profile containg a single certificate.</p>

<h1 id="planned-features">Planned Features</h1>

<p>I will continue to work hard on this project and implement all features I tested in my proof of concept as well as the features requested by the community.</p>

<p>Here are some of the upcoming features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Support for all Apple profile payloads.</li>
  <li>Support for all Apple MCX settings.</li>
  <li>Support for adding multiple payloads in a profile where the payload type allows it.</li>
  <li>Ability to disable/enable single keys in any payload</li>
  <li>Additive mode where you start with an empty payload and only add the keys you want.</li>
  <li>Reading/Updating profiles on a JSS, or any mdm that offers an API for that.</li>
  <li>Ability to create profiles from arbitrary preferences or plist files. (similar to <a href="https://github.com/timsutton/mcxToProfile">mcxToProfile</a>).</li>
  <li>Crowdsourced 3rd party preference profiles and their possible preference keys.</li>
  <li>And many more…</li>
</ul>

<p>Please add your feature requests or feedback on the <a href="https://github.com/erikberglund/ProfileCreator/issues">ProfileCreator GitHub</a>.</p>
